# I used three core mechanics in my game: using a mouse to point and click at different objects and move between rooms (bedroom and desk), a "sleep" minigame related to anxiety where the player has to try getting rid of worries and intrusive thoughts by clicking on them on time, and a school/work-related minigame where the player has to match assignments to the days they are due. I wanted both minigames to feel fast-paced and frustrating to mimic a sense of helplessness and a lack of agency. As the player loses in minigames, the two rooms lose more and more color, which essentially works as a health bar--once the rooms lose color entirely, the player loses the game. Since there's three stages to this process (three lives), the player is able to play both minigames, as well as one more based on their preferences--ultimately, deciding to prioritize between health (sleep) and work (assignments). This decision is supposed to feel somewhat futile since they lead to the same outcome: a sense of failure, in one way or another.
